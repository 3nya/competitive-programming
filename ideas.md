## possible event ideas

- collab with cs124 honors

## other general suggestions

- make the discord more active
    - have a channel to solve daily codeforces problems, leetcode, advent of
    code
    - encourage people to share about good problems they find, what they've been
    practicing recently, etc.

- add more structure into the practices
    - make discussing solutions an offical part of saturda practices and not
    just a hang around and chat with pizza
    - similarly, set aside time for problem discussion for the thursday
    practices too and let people share their own solutions instead of listening
    to the D-man yap
