## possible event ideas

- Collaboration with CS124 honors (begineer friendly programming competition, similar
to how CS124 honors collaborates with HackIllinois for begineer friendly
hackathons). 

- Special occasional competitions just for beginners (Codeforces div 4).
    - Let higher level people write problemsets? Not quite sure how useful this
      is as actual practice but it seems like fun.

- Leetcode discussion sections (interview prep) taught by ICPC club members. 

These ideas will encourage students outside of ICPC to join and practice their
programming! 

## other general suggestions

- Making the Discord more active
    - Have a channel to solve daily Codeforces problems, Leetcode, Advent of
    Code, etc. 
    - encourage people to share about good problems they find, what they've been
    practicing recently, etc.

- Add more structure into the practices
    - Make discussing solutions an offical part of Saturday practices and not
    just a hang around and chat with pizza.
    - Similarly, set aside time for problem discussion for the Thursday
    practices too and let people share their own solutions instead of listening
    to the D-man yap.

- Make the Thursday practices more approachable for beginners?
    - I'm not sure if there were orientation type stuff that explained what the
      club was about at the start of the semester that I missed...
    - But right now it feels like you need a lot of experience with programming
      and self-discipline to actually get anything out of the ICPC practices.

- Keep a schedule of upcoming events and practices somewhere
    - On Discord, the website, etc.
    - Let people know ahead of time so they can plan their schedules around it

- Bring back IPL
    - Adding friendly competition into club will probably drive engagement
    - More opportunities for people to get involved

- Updating the website
- Get people to take photos of practices, events, etc. to put on the website and
on social media
- Merchandise for ICPC club members that is availible for purchase.
