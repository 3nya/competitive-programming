icpc social media outreach ideas:

## Possible Event Ideas

- Collaboration with CS124 honors (begineer friendly programming competition, similar
to how CS124 honors collaborates with HackIllinois for begineer friendly
hackathons). 

- Special occasional competitions just for beginners (Codeforces div 4).
    - Let higher level people write problemsets? Not quite sure how useful this
      is as actual practice but it seems like fun.

- Leetcode discussion section (interview prep) taught by ICPC club members. 

These ideas will encourage students outside of ICPC to join and practice their
programming, as well as fostering a more welcoming environment within the club.

## General Changes

- Making the Discord more active
    - Have a channel to solve daily Codeforces problems, Leetcode, Advent of
    Code, etc. 
    - Encourage people to share about good problems they find, what they've been
    practicing recently, etc. Potentially having a daily LeetCode/CodeForces channel and study plans.

- Add more structure into the practices
    - Make discussing solutions an offical part of Saturday practices and not
    just a hang around and chat with pizza.
    - Similarly, set aside time for problem discussion for the Thursday
    practices too and let people share their own solutions. 
    - Make the Thursday practices more approachable for beginners. 

- Keep a schedule of upcoming events and practices somewhere
    - On a Google Calendar which can be posted on Discord and integrated in the website.
    - Allows people to know ahead of time so they can plan their schedules around it.

- Bring back IPL
    - Adding friendly competition into club can drive engagement.
    - Friendlier competition for those involved with ICPC, but unable to participate in regionals and latter competitions. 

- Updating the website
  
- Merchandise for ICPC club members that is availible for purchase.
